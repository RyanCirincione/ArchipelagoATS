# Against The Storm

## What does randomization do to this game?
All resources are blocked from being acquired until their Item is received from Archipelago.
If blueprints are shuffled, the standard means of acquiring them by reputation draft rewards will be disabled.
Optionally, all production recipes can be shuffled.

## What Against The Storm items are randomized?
"Items" in this case are the ability to acquire the blocked resources. The resource exceptions to this are only Wood and the Waters, and the acquistion exceptions are embarkation bonuses, and building deconstruction.
In addition, blueprints can be shuffled as well, and will be added as core bluperints for every settlement once received from the multiworld.

## What do Locations look like in Against the Storm?

    * Bring a species to 50 Resolve for each species
    * Win a game with 30 villagers in fully upgraded housing for each species
* Biomes
    * Earn a configurable amount of Reputation for each biome
    * Achieve a victory in each biome
* Trade
    * *These work by turning in the given resources to a custom neighbor found in the trade route menu*
        * 10, 100, and 1000 Amber
        * 20 of each of the packs
        * 200 of each of the waters

    * Complete an order in each of the first 9 slots
    * Upgrade a hearth to each tier

## What is the goal of this game when randomized?
To reforge a seal in the sealed forest. Note: you can play the sealed forest from the Training Expedition as well!

# Known Issues as of v0.4.0
* The trade related locations, because they are handled by trade routes, proc trade route related in game effects.
* With `blueprint_items` on, the reputation blueprint reward button doesn't correctly disable if you connect during a run. When you reward changes, it should correct itself.
