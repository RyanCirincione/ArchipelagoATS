# Against The Storm

## What does randomization do to this game?
All resources are blocked from being acquired until their Item is received from Archipelago. TODO: enable dev console even in non-experimental branch.

## What Against The Storm items are randomized?
"Items" in this case are the ability to acquire the blocked resources. The resource exceptions to this are only Wood and the Waters, and the acquistion exceptions are embarkation bonuses, and building deconstruction.

## What do Locations look like in Against the Storm?
Locations are essentially just a list of custom deeds designed to cover many aspects of the game. Here is an overview of them:

* Species
    * Earn your first Reputation through Resolve for each species
    * Bring a species to 50 Resolve for each species
    * Win a game with 30 villagers in fully upgraded housing for each species
* Biomes
    * Earn your first Reputation point for each biome
    * Earn your 10th Reputation point for each biome
    * Achieve a victory in each biome
* Resource "Trades"
    * *These deeds work for now by just detecting when you have the required resource, and immediately remove them from your warehouse to grant you the location. Ideally in the future this would look like the delivery Orders*
    * 10, 100, and 1000 Amber
    * 20 of each of the packs
    * 200 of each of the waters
* Others
    * Complete an order in each of the first 9 slots
    * Upgrade a hearth to each tier
    * Complete a Dangerous & Forbidden glade event

## What is the goal of this game when randomized?
To reforge a seal in the sealed forest.

## Current Version (Alpha v0.1.0) Limitations and Issues
* Needing to use the experimental build to see the dev console is not ideal
